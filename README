# multiplexd

A lightweight, scalable multiplayer server framework designed for efficient connection management and direct port routing.

## Overview

multiplexd is a C-based server framework that enables multiplayer applications through efficient socket and connection management. Each user receives a dedicated port while sharing socket resources, allowing for scalable and efficient multiplayer server applications.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Router**
  - Manages new connections
  - Assigns unique ports to users
  - Tracks port usage
  - Initializes socket buckets

2. **Socket Pools**
  - Organized in buckets for scalability
  - Groups multiple sockets
  - Manages socket lifecycle

3. **Individual Sockets** (In Development)
  - Will handle multiple user connections
  - Direct port access
  - Non-blocking I/O
  - epoll-based multiplexing

## Project Status

Currently implementing core architecture:
- Basic router functionality
- Socket pool and bucket management
- Socket implementation (In Progress)

Future work will focus on:
- Socket connection handling
- epoll implementation
- Thread management
- Resource monitoring

## Technical Stack
- Written in C
- Uses epoll (planned)
- Thread-per-socket design
- Non-blocking I/O (planned)
